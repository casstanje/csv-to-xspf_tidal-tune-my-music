# csv-to-xspf for tidal library exports
## IMPORTANT:
this is probably easier to use instead: https://github.com/casstanje/tidal-library-to-xspf

a badly made converter from tidal csv library exports to xspf playlist files. you need to manually delete any existing xspf files in the selected export folder, because the script just appends to existing files
